## About

dcm2niix can convert Canon (nÃ© Toshiba) DICOM format images to NIfTI. This page notes vendor specific conversion details.

## Avoid Classic DICOM

Users of Canon MRI equipment are strongly advised to export data from their scanners as enhanced DICOM (with all images from the series stored as a single file) rather than classic DICOM (each 2D slice stored as a separate file). Limitations of the Canon classic DICOMs are described [here](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix/issues/495) and [here](https://github.com/neurolabusc/dcm_qa_canon).

## Diffusion Weighted Imaging Notes

In contrast to several other vendors, Toshiba used public tags to report diffusion properties. Specifically, [DiffusionBValue (0018,9087)](http://dicomlookup.com/lookup.asp?sw=Tnumber&q=(0018,9087)) and [DiffusionGradientOrientation (0018,9089)](http://dicomlookup.com/lookup.asp?sw=Tnumber&q=(0018,9089)). Be aware that these tags are only populated for images where a diffusion gradient is applied. Consider a typical diffusion series where some volumes are acquired with B=0 while others have B=1000. In this case, only the volumes with B>0 will report a DiffusionBValue. These coordinates are with respect to the scanner bore, not image space.

Since the acquisition by Canon, these public tags are no longer populated for images saved in classic 2D DICOM format. The diffusion gradient directions are now stored in the ASCII Image Comments tag. Like GE (but unlike [Siemens, GE and Toshiba](https://www.na-mic.org/wiki/NAMIC_Wiki:DTI:DICOM_for_DWI_and_DTI)), these directions are with respect to the image space, not the scanner bore. Further, gradient direction is not adjusted for phase encoding polarity, and it is impossible to determine phase encoding polarity. For detailed discussion and a validation dataset that exhibits these attributes please see [dcm_qa_canon](https://github.com/neurolabusc/dcm_qa_canon). A Canon classic DICOM DWI image may report:

```
 (0018,9087) FD 1500                                     #   8, 1 DiffusionBValue
 (0020,4000) LT [b=1500(0.445,0.000,0.895)]              #  26, 1 ImageComments
```

In contrast, when exporting images as enhanced (4D) DICOM, information is stored in public tags and does appear to compensate for phase encode polarity. These coordinates are with respect to the scanner bore, not image space. A Canon classic DICOM DWI image may report: 

```
(0018,9087) FD 1500                                     #   8, 1 DiffusionBValue
(0018,9089) FD 0.29387456178665161\-0.95365142822265625\-0.064700603485107422 #  24, 3 DiffusionGradientOrientation
```

## Unknown Properties

The [BIDS format](https://bids.neuroimaging.io) can record several sequence properties that are useful for processing MRI data. The DICOM headers created by Toshiba scanners are very clean and minimalistic, and do not report several of these advanced properties. Therefore, dcm2niix is unable to populate these properties of the JSON file. This reflects a limitation of the DICOM images, not of dcm2niix.

 - SliceTiming is not recorded. This can be useful for slice time correction.
 - Phase encoding polarity is not record. This is useful for undistortion with [TOPUP](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/topup).
