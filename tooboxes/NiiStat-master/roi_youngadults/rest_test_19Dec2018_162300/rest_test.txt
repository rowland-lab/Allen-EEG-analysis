Only analyzing voxels non-zero in at least 1 individuals.
**** Analyzing rest_test with 77 participants for 4 behavioral variables across 2 (of 116) regions/voxels.
Computing glm (pooled-variance t-test, linear regression) for 2 regions/voxels with analyzing 4 behavioral variables (positive Z when increased image brightness correlates with increased behavioral score).
p<0.050000 Bonferroni correction for 2 tests is z=1.95996398, p<0.025000000000 (one tailed, we assume lesions always impair performance)
