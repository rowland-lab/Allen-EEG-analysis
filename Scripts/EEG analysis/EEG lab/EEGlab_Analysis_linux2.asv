%next steps
% repeat for all frequencies: delta through bb gamma
% need to look and see why sbj30 looks the way it does for coherence and if 
% there is artifact just remove it and rerun everything
% need to remake everything in for loops to make more efficient
% 
% 
% in terms of data presentation, what I'm thinking is:
% 
% 
% sorry first you can show erp's
% then beta on its own
% makes sense to probably show the coherence matrices first so they see all 
% electrodes (also don't forget the diff matrices as well) - show which
% ever shows the biggest differences - individual or group
% then drill down to c3-c4 bar plots perhaps
% then after that you can show lin reg
% 
% would be nice to have data on resting state fmri as well
%just occurred to me that you didn't do linear regression vs phase diff
%calcs, no that's not true you did with linreg2 and I believe the direction
%of the diff calc is correct
%can think about also normalizing hold as baseline then making sure that
%stim has higher connectivity at pos than sham bc right now it doesn't
%but if you do that, you will have to rerun everything and it may be that
%the lin regs come out more positive that way
also make sure you look at the few subjects that had post 10 and 15 minutes and look
to see if connectivity continues to increase
